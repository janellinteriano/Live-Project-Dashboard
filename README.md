<h1>Live Project</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>As a student of the Tech Academy, I have spent the last two weeks participating in a Live Project with my peers. During this time we have worked as a team to add on to an interactive website used for tracking various hobbies and activities. The project was built using Python, Django, SQLite, and HTML/CSS. My main task was to build an app for a hobby of my choosing. I chose to create an application used to plan crochet projects. During this, I have been able to complete different frontend and backend user stories that make the project overall more dynamic and unique. I have also been given experience working with APIs and DataScraping in order to get up to date information on different topics. This project also gave me the opportunity to further build project management skills that will be useful for the rest of my career in Software Development.</p>

<h2>Building the Basic App</h2>
<p>My task for this story was to create a basic app with html/css to track a certain hobby or activity. I chose to create an app used to track and plan crochet project ideas. I created a base file for the whole application and styled all of the pages. This is a snippet of the home page and navbar html.</p>

<h2>Backend User Stories</h2>
<ul>
<li>API</li>
<li>Beautiful Soup</li>
</ul>
<h2>API</h2>
<p>My task for this story was to render information queried from an API of my choosing. I chose an API that would show the user sunrise and sunset times each day for Atlanta, Georgia. I created a function that would parse through the JSON file returned and that would display the times I wanted for the location.</p>

<h2>Beautiful Soup</h2>
<p>This story was about webscraping and my task was to find information I wanted sourced from another website. I then made a function to parse through the html file and grab the data element I wanted. This allowed me to only display a paragraph I felt was relevant for my app.</p>
