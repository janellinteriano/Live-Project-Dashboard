<h1>Live Project</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>As a student of the Tech Academy, I have spent the last two weeks participating in a Live Project with my peers. During this time we have worked as a team to add on to an interactive website used for tracking various hobbies and activities. The project was built using Python, Django, SQLite, and HTML/CSS. Along the way I have been able to complete different frontend and backend user stories that make the project overall more dynamic and unique. I have also been given experience working with APIs and DataScraping in order to get up to date information on different topics. This project also gave me the opportunity to further build project management skills that will be useful for the rest of my career in Software Development.</p>
